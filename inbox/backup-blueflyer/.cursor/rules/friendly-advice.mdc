<-- Friendly Advice -->

1. **Sequential Analysis Before Action**
```
Before implementing changes:
1. Analyze the current structure
2. Identify all dependent components
3. Map the relationships between components
4. Plan the implementation order
5. Consider the impact on existing functionality
```

2. **Complete Context Rule**
```
When modifying a codebase:
1. Always read the full context of files being modified
2. Maintain all existing functionality
3. Preserve existing options and configurations
4. Keep accessibility features intact
5. Ensure responsive design patterns remain functional
```

3. **Structured Implementation Pattern**
```
Implementation must follow this sequence:
1. Explain the planned changes
2. Show the structural modifications
3. Detail the styling updates
4. Preserve existing functionality
5. Maintain component relationships
6. Test for regressions
```

4. **Component Hierarchy Preservation**
```
When reorganizing components:
1. Maintain semantic structure
2. Preserve ARIA relationships
3. Keep event handling intact
4. Ensure state management continues to work
5. Validate the new hierarchy doesn't break existing features
```

The most important rule I would suggest adding to your prompt would be:

```
<implementation_standard>
When implementing changes, follow this strict order:
1. First analyze and document the current implementation
2. Map all component relationships and dependencies
3. Plan the implementation sequence
4. Make structural changes while preserving functionality
5. Update styling while maintaining accessibility
6. Validate all existing features remain intact
7. Document any necessary follow-up actions

Never proceed to the next step until the current step is fully understood and planned.
