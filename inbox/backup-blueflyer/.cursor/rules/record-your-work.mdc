# Project Plan Update Guidelines

After **every single message**, update the `PROJECT_PLAN.md` file to capture all implemented changes. This update **must be performed every time**, and **existing content must not be deleted** unless absolutely necessary to record progress.

## Update Requirements:

### 1. Implementation Details
- **Record all new features, bug fixes, and code improvements** that have been added.
- **Summarize functionality changes**, including any important technical details.

### 2. API Updates (if applicable)
- **Document any changes** to API endpoints, including:
  - Request/response formats
  - Parameters
  - Example usage
- **Provide clear instructions** on how to interact with the updated API.

### 3. UX Changes (if applicable)
- **Describe modifications** to the user interface or user experience.
- **Include specific instructions** for user interactions, such as:
  - Navigation changes
  - Button functions
  - Form interactions

## Important Notes:
- **Every Message**: The `PROJECT_PLAN.md` **must be updated after every message**—no exceptions.
- **Preserve Existing Content**: Do **not** delete any existing content unless it is **necessary** to record progress (e.g., replacing outdated information).

By strictly following these guidelines, you ensure that all changes are accurately tracked and documented in the project plan.
